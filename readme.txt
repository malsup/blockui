This is another jquery.blockUI plugin based on the great blockUI from Mike Alsup.

The idea was that these changes would be integrated in the blockUI from Mike, but as he is pretty ignorant to my pull requests, I cut the chains to the root and let the plugin grow it's own life.  ;-)


In the changelog you can find the additions and changes to the original blockUI v2.33

In next versions I will split up the functionalities into seperate parts.  The blockUI core functionality, and additions.
